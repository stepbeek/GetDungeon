    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my potently bad, potentially boring, programmatic bundle of fun. This game is intended for semi-geeky users
        to url-hack their way around a text-based RPG world. </p>

    <p>This game uses some session data on the client side to track things like player location in the world and player status.</p>

    <p>To get started, simple GET a /start</p>
